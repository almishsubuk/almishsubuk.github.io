# Personal Portfolio with React.js
This project was made with React.js. This is my first project using react.js, and is much better than my old portfolio. 
## What I learned
I learned the basics of React.js, and how to setup, create, and run projects. I learned lots and this helped me to create a base of my react.js knowledge.
## What I still need to learn
I still need to learn a lot of things about react.js, including things like hooks and useeffect hooks, etc, as this project was very basic and not very dynamic.
